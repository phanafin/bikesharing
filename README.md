## Overview of the Analysis
  Our clients enjoyed the experience of renting bicycles in New York City through a company known as CitiBike and would like to expand the idea to their home city of Des Moines, Iowa.  The task at hand is to use data provided from CitiBike, and parse it in a fashion that would show would-be investors of the likelihood of the success of this venture. The presentation will show the potential investors decision making information like, possible saturation to bike stations, who to market to as far as gender is concerned, as well as peak times and days of operation.  Should the data be considered as a relation of the population of New York City, vs the population of Des Moines, the investors wold be able to get an accurate estimate of potential revenue for this venture and guage the safety of their investment.

## Summary
The City of New York has a population of 8,336,817 people and in the month of August, CitiBike has 259,316 transactions.  Des Moines had a population of 214,237 people, or about 2.5% the population of NYC.  Allowing for the same ratio, Des Moines could assume 6,664 transactions in the month of August.  Armed with this data, they could start a marketing campaign aimed at men (since the male segment makes up the vast majority of users in NYC), and consider future marketing to women a growth potential for increased revenue.  Also, based on these projections, they could get a better idea of the number of bikes that they would need, base maintenance on the non-peak hours of typical rentals, and be able to decide on a price per hour fee for profit potential.
